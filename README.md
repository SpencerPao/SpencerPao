My name is Spencer and I do content around Data Science, Financial Engineering, and Software Engineering. I really enjoy exploring and explaining new topics and how these topics can be applied in everyday life. I really enjoy working with scripting languages such as R and Python. Furthermore, I love to create frameworks that act as the building blocks for other really cool and applicable topics.
